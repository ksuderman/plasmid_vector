# Notes:
# - This is the weak P3 promoter from S. aureus SaeRS system
# - -35 box: TTGCCT (deviates from optimal TTGACA consensus)
# - -10 box: TATAAT (perfect consensus)
# - 20 bp spacer (sub-optimal, contributes to weakness)
# - Mutagenesis studies showed -35 and -10 regions are critical for function
